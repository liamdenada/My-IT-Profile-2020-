 <h2>Personal Information</h2> 
 <p>I was born in rural NSW and moved to Sydney when I was 18 years old. I am currently employed as a Coach and Administrative Officer at a Martial Arts Academy on Sydney’s North Shore. I graduated from South Grafton High School in 2013. I am currently enrolled in an IT degree at RMIT university and am studying via Open University. As well as work and education I compete in Muay Thai Kickboxing, Submission Grappling and Folkstyle Wrestling Competitions at both regional and state levels.</p>
  <br>
  
   <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
 <p>From making video games to website and app design, I have been tinkering with aspects of IT since my family got its 1st computer in 2004. Now as an adult I have started this degree to learn more about technology. The parts of Information Technology that interest me are mainly cyber security, application design and sharing Technology with the world. I am passionate about making the world a better place through the tools that Information Technology supplies us. With the evolution of virus software and morally good technology comes the growth and evolution of morally bad technology like phishing software and other types of malware. According the Institute of Data The Cyber Security Industry was work $75 billion USD in 2015 and was given an estimated value for 2020 as $140 billion USD. (Institute of data, 2019). This shows the potential growth of such a new and more exciting part of Information Technology. </p>

 <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  <p>Cyber Security Specialist isn't a job that I could apply for right at this moment but is my ideal career in Information Technology. Being a Cyber Security Specialist gives you a large industry to work around with a large amount of career progression. (Seek, 2020).  From small developers to the Australian Defense Force there is always opportunity.  Now my IT skills are limited to fundamental hardware knowledge of devices, use of basic formatting software like word or excel, the ability to edit videos and a basic knowledge of the programming language python. In order to become a Cyber Security Specialist you must have at least a fundamental knowledge of computer software and hardware, experience writing code, a sound understanding of storage, an in-depth knowledge of Cross Domain solutions and experience threat modelling data structures. CDS (cross domain solutions) is a system specifically designed to minimize risk while transferring data. (Introduction to Cross Domain Solutions, 2020). Threat Modelling is the process of identifying, communicating and understanding potential threats. Threat modelling not only involves recognizing threats, but also mitigating the impact of them. (GeeksforGeeks, 2020). These are skills that I plan to develop over time through this degree. There are cyber security courses and bootcamps run by large tech companies that will give you the role specific skills that you will need for a job of this kind. Even the NSW government has its own program. After my degree I plan to enroll and become more specialized and more skilled to further my journey in IT. (CERTIFICATE IV IN CYBER SECURITY, 2020)</p>

  <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<p>As humanity has evolved, information has been a deciding factor in which societies thrive and which ones fail. The current landscape of technology shapes our culture, society and even at a personal level, us. The internet and the knowledge and information that come along with it should be easily accessible. As we progress into the future as a society, it becomes a fundamental human need to keep up with the ever-evolving world, this requires access to the information that the internet provides. The UNs Declaration of Human Rights includes an article that reflects this principal, Article 19, “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 2019). 
 <br>
 To put together a profile that gives a specific overview of myself I have taken 3 tests that go into details about my personality, work ethic and learning preferences. The Myers-Briggs personality test assigned me the personality of the Logician. A logician possesses a unique perspective, a large amount of creativity and a strong intellect. Only 3% of the population will get this result.://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality The Vark Learning Test (https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/) is a Learning Style test developed to show what kind of learning you prefer. The Test showed that I am a visual, aural and, more than anything, a Kinesthetic learner. Kinesthetic learning is learning through physical activity. My score from the Vark Learning Test was 5 for Visual learning, 5 for Aural learning, 1 in read/write and 8 on Kinesthetic learning. People who prefer to learn Kinesthetically, learn better through practical exercises, experiences, examples, case studies and trial and error.  The 3rd test that I used was the Truity online personality test (https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/26089654). This was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is a manager in the HR department of a large company. The test main focused on traits that affected your relationships with your colleagues. The test gave me a 54% for neuroticism, 56% agreeableness, 60% extraversion and 90% openness. Openness describes an individual’s tendency to think in complex, abstract ways. People who are high in Openness are abstract thinkers, while people who are low in Openness are concrete thinkers. These tests supply information that would suggest that I have a very logical thought process, I am open to new ideas and am much better at learning through physical means rather than visual or speech. The test results also show that I will need to work on being more receptive to feedback and be more outgoing. As the Information Technology industry becomes more forward facing, being introverted could potentially be a hinderance, especially when working in teams. In order to combat this, extra social attentiveness will most likely be required for group projects. Taking these results into account, when looking for Teammates to assist in the group projects I should choose people with similar personality features as well as learning style as it will make communication and work much easier. </p>

  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  <p>My project idea started as a list of Countries that don’t allow you to view information on the internet that isn’t inherently evil.  After looking further into the subject, I realized that most Countries have some level of security around the internet that they allow their citizens to access. Even here in Australia our information and messages are monitored for key words. As this is not a black and white issue, a moderate level of monitoring and censorship is needed to stop all malicious websites or websites with potentially illegal content. According to the world Tourism Organization the Asia Pacific Region had 348 million tourist arrivals just two years ago (International Tourism Highlights, 2019). This shows a giant potential market that might not have the information that they need to safely travel in the modern world. With applications with great user experience making up 85% of booking decisions made by travelers in 2019, all signs point to a web-based application (digital trends of the travel industry, 2020). With the world waiting for international travel to open back up it highlights a great market opportunity has arisen.
   <br>
   This project in its alpha will be able to tell anxious travelers exactly the level of censorship and overview that a Country's Government has over its internet. We are lucky enough to live in a Country that has a great respect for the freedoms of its citizens, only restricting a small amount of online content, most of which being harmful information or illegal content. Unfortunately, not all the world is like this. Many countries have used different laws and lack of public access to infrastructure to restrict the access of its citizens to much of the information freely provided on the internet. My project will be a web-based application to help plan travel and monitor the censorship and security of the internet in different areas. Not knowing what information, you can access in a particular country or better yet what google searches could land you in jail or worse is a much-needed security benefit that I know myself and many others would appreciate. The central project at alpha will require breaking the information into three separate branches of information. One central piece of information, The Countries, and two sub pieces of information, the magnitude of censorship and laws regarding internet and internet censorship. Along with a plan to use visual representation for the magnitude of internet censorship a country has, the project will also give a general rating. This general rating will be a cumulation of the level of censorship along with the laws of the country’s government. Some countries laws affect not only what websites you can look at but what you can say or do on any particular website or application. For example, North Korea has laws that restrict residents and visitors from accessing all websites and applications that they don’t deem align with their views. While researching this project I realized how hard it is to find information on internet censorship, especially a country governments' individual laws regarding it. Some countries information is very easy to find but others are non-existent. This motivated me further to create a central hub for this information and put it in the hands of anyone who needs it. The web-based application will use python to show the level of censorship of all countries and give information on select countries that you will need it for. The applications range will go from making sure you stay out of jail by not posting the wrong pictures to telling you which countries a VPN is suggested for. As this is a very linear information driven project, I was able to choose python to store and convey the information because it is a language, I'm relatively familiar with. It's in built functions and straight forward interface make it an easy choice for a first language.The basic skills required for this project are a very basic knowledge of the python programming language. After inputting the information into the list using my list function (my_list =[]) the information will be separated into 3 different parts the Country’s, The Laws and the Magnitude of Censorship. This information will then be converted to an easy to decipher display using HTML wrapping.  The main issue with this information is that it's not easy to find in the walls of text, which Is why a simple clean visual display is very important. Using the linear search algorithm in Python and  HTML wrapping the project will have a search function to help people get to their information destination faster (Output Data as an HTML File with Python, 2020). The ideal outcome of the project would be to create a product to educate the public the current reality of the state of censorship of the internet. Aswell as opening people's eyes to the pattern of consistent censorship of the internet and free information by many governments around the world.
